Physics and behaviour:
	[ ] Not handling all collisions from GTA2 maps (FLAT faces)
	[ ] Fix block geometry to be outputting actual array of polygons, not 5 faces as it is right now
	[ ] Tracing a ray against map with start == end doesn't check if the point lies on some surface
	[ ] TRACE ERROR: Fall through in edges like [419.00; 431.00] (when player is exactly there, minus the distance keeping)
	[ ] Bad behaviour at building edges
	[ ] Improper collision with Z=0.0 blocks (which are not water)
	[ ] Can sometimes go through buildings and floor when moving at high velocity

	[X] Going down the slopes makes you fall down, instead of smoothly moving down
	[X] You can get stuck in point where two building edges match (4 walls go into same spot)
	[X] Player ped must be kept at least X units away from nearest wall
	[X] Going higher than Z=10.0 and moving on X axis causes tracing to check infinite amount of blocks (in release mode only)
	[X] Fall through level when going against a solid walls in some places


Crashes and freezes:
	[ ] Running two copies of the game freezes newest one
	[ ] Crash in block tracing (when map was removed before trace was complete/in middle of trace)
	[ ] Crash when attempting to write to server listen connection (after closing it causes heap overflow)
	[ ] Crash when network connection is shut down while message buffer is still used (recv buffer, but also send buffer possible)

	[X] Crash/memory error if connecting to some host, and connection could not be made
	[X] Crash under restricted user in Windows
	[X] Crash when adding new console line (console.cpp:121) consoleLines[0]->Size is invalid
	[X] Crash on exit freeing up some console-related resources
	[X] Spontaneous crash with "out of memory" after walking a lot around the map; (was related to console bug)


Graphics and geometry:
	[ ] Tile conversion tool adds unneccessary alpha to building tiles/building tiles must be rendered without alpha unless FLAT
	[ ] Improper normals for FLAT surfaces. Might want to change FLAT surfaces behaviour for OpenGTA2 map format at all
	[ ] 0.25x0.25x1.0 blocks sometimes don't have lid surface
	[ ] Obvious shaking of player ped at low FPS (player position exceeds camera position in update order...)
	[ ] Map VBO cache is not updated when screen size is changed
	[ ] -8.0f offset shouldn't be required in drawing console input cursor (wrong text dimensions, off by a char?)

	[X] Missing special symbols in message font.
	[X] In conversion tools effective size of atlas is incorrect (does not take sprite sizes in mind, only data). Remaining area must be black/zero alpha.


Code-related:
	[ ] Code must include all header files it requires, instead of single OpenGTA2.h (or not?)
	[ ] All padding must be done using spaces, and not tabs
	[ ] Remove any whitespaces in end of lines
	[ ] Map.planeShouldExist checks every block, should check groups of 64x64 blocks (faster!)
	[ ] Move actual collision checking to Map.traceList (and probably rename it to something else)
	[ ] Check if all instances which use DataArray use ID instead of POINTER to data in case data is potentially reallocable
	[ ] There is no way to unallocate a string allocated with "alloc_string"
	[ ] Revise all string comparsion cases - strncmp/strncpy do not work as expected
	[ ] Chunk file merger doesn't properly merge first (header) chunk
	[ ] Convar parser doesn't parse long strings (in brackets)
	[ ] Erasing previous character using backspace in console will break UTF8 encoding
	[ ] Full support for CONVAR_CSTRING type

	[X] Convar: can't request convar with more than 1 parameter
	[X] Convar.Execute doesn't check existance of the convar
	[X] [unrelated] Convar: can't GetString from convars which have read callback
	[X] [unrelated] Convar: can't SetString to float and int datatypes
	[X] Chunk loader was reading beyond chunk limits in all formats, because of error in generation tools
	[X] Font manager performs russian-letters-fix for GTA2 fonts. This must be done by convert tools
	[X] Add support for UTF-8
	[X] Font.TextWidth(), Font.TextHeight() not implemented (and generally font rendering sucks)
	[X] Deltatime using "curtime()" instead of GLFW timer
	[X] Huge deltatime in first server frame (due to resources load)
	[X] Map caching code uses last access time from client timer
	[X] Leak in Map.LoadMap when map file didn't exist
	[X] Precaching empty map from [-33554432;-33554432] during game, or during load
	[X] "Assert failed: sine (.\matrix.cpp:23)" in log
	[X] "Warning: animation chunk is empty" instead of "Loading animations..." message
	[X] logWrite didnt properly unlock mutex if log could not be written to


Speeling errors:
	[ ]

	[X] "SPRG" instead of "SPRX", "SPRB" instead of "PALB" in STY2TEX


Network:
	[ ] NewConnection() isn't protected by mutex against connection list change

	[X] Networking might not be thread-safe
	[X] Potential crash if message is still generated (NewMessage(), but before Send()), and connection closes. Add mutex to account for this!


Map design:
	[ ] No connection between three GTA2 districts
